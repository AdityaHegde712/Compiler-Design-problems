Given a few data structures, with only int input

=> Array, linked list, binary search tree, hash map - For each, do insertion, deletion, and lookup
Measure time taken for each, and output in tabular format.

Rand values, about 5000 for each

Given a random collection of elements, implement insertion, deletion, and lookup in Arrays, LinkedLists, Binary Search Trees, and Hash maps. Compare the time complexities (time taken) for each.
