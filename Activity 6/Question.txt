Note that a symbol table consists of a set of tokens.
Inverted index is one of the indexing techniques for implementing Symbol Table. 

Consider different sets
S1 = [1,2,4,5]
S2 = [1,3,5,6]
S3 = [2,3,4,6]
S4 = [1,2,4,6,7,8,9]

Find hashes
h(s) = min(S) % size(s)

Make a dictionary of hashes
Your input is a list of sets
Your output needs to be the symbol table.
